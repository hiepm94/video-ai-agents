## Getting Started

We have detailed the steps to get you started, in this [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) file.

> ðŸ’¡ Having vaas running is just the first step! Now that you have it up and running, it's time to actually understand how it works.

## ðŸ’° What's the cost?

You'll be able to run vaas examples while staying at 0 cost. That's because we'll use OpenAI and Groq for our LLM and VLM calls, which offer freemium plans as such:

| Provider | Free Credits |
| -------- |  ----------- |
| OpenAI   |  $5 on first sign-up |
| Groq | 500,000 tokens / day

> [!NOTE]  
> In this setup, for running the vaas Agent example - the freemium plans are enough.
